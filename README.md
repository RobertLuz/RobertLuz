- 👋 Hi, I’m @RobertLuz
- 👀 I’m interested in Data Analytics and coding used in Machine Learning.  Just started learning about ML recently, and it is really fascinating!
- Really like using Python with Pandas, Numpy and Matplotlib to analyze, clean, and vizualize data.  I have used ols from statsmodels to create linear models for data sets.  Always excited to learn more!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Data Analytics through Springboard.  Nearing the end of the program now, so I'm trying to branch out and continue learing more of what is out there in terms of new technology and how
- it can be applied to data analysis.  Looking to network and meet new people in the industry.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on different ML projects, or other projects that I may be interested in that I don't know exist!  
- 📫 How to reach me email me at rluz@ccsnh.edu, or message me on linked in www.linkedin.com/in/robert-luz-rpcv-53807928b.  I also post math videos (just started, so they aren't the best, but I
- want to continually improve!) on YouTube: @robertluz9733
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him I guess, works for me
- ⚡ Fun fact: I've served in the Peace Corps - probably one of the best experiences of my life! - I would encourage anyone to do it,
- and I could see myself doing another tour in retirement, if I'm still physically able.
